Start with base cases if the length of each string is different return false. If they have a length of 1 compare the two strings.

Create a dict to store letters and how many times they occur for each string.

iterate through both strings at the same time and check to see if the letter is in the strings dict. If it is add 1 to the key's(letter) value. If it isnt add the key(letter) to the dict with 1 as its initial value.

Then return true or false if the 2 dictionaries match.
